      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), penetration testing, and cloud security. With over two years of experience in both technical and consulting roles, I’ve contributed to enterprise-level security assessments, compliance automation projects, and offensive security simulations.</p>
      <p>Currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I bring a blend of academic excellence (GPA: 3.833) and hands-on skills to every challenge. My journey spans from scripting in Unix/Linux to deploying secure network architectures, crafting GRC templates, performing vulnerability scans, and exploring AI for threat detection.</p>
      <p>I believe in continuous learning, creativity in problem-solving, and using technology to create meaningful security solutions. Whether it's refining compliance posture, simulating attacks in a home lab, or contributing to cutting-edge research, I strive to push the boundaries of cybersecurity excellence.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PoliLight: JSON-based Policy Enforcement Engine for IoT Edge Devices</strong><br>
          - Designed and implemented a lightweight policy engine in JSON to enforce security rules on IoT edge nodes, preventing unauthorized operations.<br>
          - Enabled modular, transparent policy management with enforcement logic triggered at the device level for real-time resilience.<br>
          - Demonstrated via a simulated network of ThingsBoard-connected devices, highlighting practical security for resource-constrained environments.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Security Lab Simulations</strong><br>
          - Completed all enterprise security lab simulations by Jones & Bartlett with 100% accuracy.<br>
          - Designed secure network architectures and implemented access control mechanisms.<br>
          - Used Infection Monkey and Nessus to simulate attacks and identify 25+ vulnerabilities.<br>
          - Tested TCP/IP, HTTP, BGP protocols for weaknesses and implemented mitigations.<br>
          - Built risk registers aligned with NIST and NY DFS Part 500 compliance.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Home Lab – Offensive Security & Exploitation</strong><br>
          - Set up Kali Linux and Metasploitable VMs to practice real-world exploit techniques.<br>
          - Exploited services like Samba, SSH, and HTTP via Metasploit and custom scripts.<br>
          - Practiced brute-force, misconfiguration, and privilege escalation attacks.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Web Exploitation & Secure Code Review</strong><br>
          - Conducted web pentests and API exploitation with Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.<br>
          - Exploited SQLi, XSS, CSRF, and login bypass vulnerabilities.<br>
          - Reviewed insecure code snippets using OWASP Top 10 and best practices.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Phishing URL Detection with AI</strong><br>
          - Evaluated Decision Tree, Random Forest, and GPT-3.5 Turbo for phishing detection.<br>
          - Achieved 96% accuracy, ensuring ML model performance aligned with cybersecurity standards.<br>
          - Built detection pipelines to classify URLs and prevent phishing threats in real-time.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reverse Phishing Simulation using AWS & BeEF Framework</strong><br>
          - Engineered a phishing simulation using a custom-crafted email that led to successful browser hook interaction.<br>
          - Deployed BeEF on an AWS EC2 instance with masked IP-based URL redirection for social engineering delivery.<br>
          - Captured live data from the victim browser without deploying a payload, showcasing risk of client-side attacks.<br>
          - Designed for awareness and ethical demonstration of phishing tactics in real-world scenarios.
        </li>

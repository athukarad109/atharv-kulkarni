      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), penetration testing, and cloud security. With over two years of experience in both technical and consulting roles, I’ve contributed to enterprise-level security assessments, compliance automation projects, and offensive security simulations.</p>
      <p>Currently pursuing my Master's in Cybersecurity at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, I bring a blend of academic excellence (GPA: 3.67) and hands-on skills to every challenge. My journey spans from scripting in Unix/Linux to deploying secure network architectures, crafting GRC templates, performing vulnerability scans, and exploring AI for threat detection.</p>
      <p>I believe in continuous learning, creativity in problem-solving, and using technology to create meaningful security solutions. Whether it's refining compliance posture, simulating attacks in a home lab, or contributing to cutting-edge research, I strive to push the boundaries of cybersecurity excellence.</p>
